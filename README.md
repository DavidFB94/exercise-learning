# [EXERCISE LEARNING](https://davidfb94.github.io/exercise-learning)

## Overview
Exercise Learning is a learning tool for anyone that wants to increase their knowledge about  
gym related exercise, and how it works the body.

Exercise Learning will quiz the user about strength training exercises, names for the muscles, and how each exercise targets different muscles.

The site allows the user to select a topic they are interested in. While in the quiz, the user gets instant feedback on their performance through the use of color and text.

This website was built as a project for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.

## UX
I started out with Wireframes for both desktop and phone. 

After creating the basic structure for the different pages, the site felt a bit empty. I added a header and footer (with link to my GitHub) to fill out the top and bottom of the screen.

I also added a "your last performance" feature to the home page.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the site to have a simple look, to let the user focus on the learning.

- `#778DA9 ` used for primary text.
- `#415A77` used for secondary text.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-415a77-778da9-e0e1dd-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I used Google fonts for fonts import.

- [Patua One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Arial]() was used for all other secondary text.

## Wireframes
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
